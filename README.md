# WhoIsWhoDeckGenerator
A deck generator for a Who Is Who game

# Usage
This is a CLI application. Required arguments are `targetDirectoryPath` and `recordsCount` Example `"C:\Program Files" 150`

Records count does not match final cards count! Wikipedia contains a lot pages that doesn't contain all data required to build a card. For a 10k cards `recordsCount` was 17000.

Github doesn't allow files above 25MB so here is output for 10K uniqure records generated by program https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XbZ_b-zQgv3xFZfA4Gp79R0aSl2Dkp9F
